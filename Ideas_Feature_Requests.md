## Step 0 — Global (used everywhere)

### Card: Status bar

**Title:** 7-day window
**Body:** I’m selecting 2 partners before the deadline. Calm urgency. Clear terms.
**Badges:** `Day {X}/7` `NDA required` `NL/EN`

### Card: Safety/legal microcopy

**Title:** Clear terms
**Body:** This is a collaboration request, not investment advice. Any revenue share is subject to written agreement and depends on product performance. No guaranteed returns.

---

## Step 1 — Landing (Hook + Trust + Clarity)

### Card 1.1 — The call

**Title:** Two partners. One turnaround.
**Body:** I need two people to help me break the loop: one financial support partner and one solo developer/mentor. Together we ship the first two apps that prove what I can do.

**CTA:** Choose your role

---

### Card 1.2 — Not hype

**Title:** This is NOT a shortcut
**Body:** I’m not one of the millions who thinks apps are easy or AI builds everything. I’ve fought for months across tools, tutorials, and broken builds. This is serious execution.

---

### Card 1.3 — Why I’m different

**Title:** Ideas are my talent
**Body:** My strength is app ideation and feature thinking—fast, deep, and constant. What I need is the bridge from architect to shipped product.

---

### Card 1.4 — The quartet

**Title:** The symbolic quartet
**Body:** The magic happens when four forces align: me (architect), you (builder/backer), an investor (breathing room), and AI (leverage). Structure turns it into results.

---

### Card 1.5 — Two apps = proof

**Title:** Two apps change everything
**Body:** I don’t need ten apps. I need two shipped apps to show proof:
**Bullets:**

* Lifemanagement Stack (my life back on rails)
* IdeaFabric (portable idea blueprint machine)

---

### Card 1.6 — From scattered to vault

**Title:** Chaos → data vault

---

### Card 1.7 — The turning point

**Title:** The snowball flips
**Body:** Until now the snowball was negative: stress → fear → delays → debt. With breathing room + mentorship, it flips: structure → shipping → proof → compounding.
