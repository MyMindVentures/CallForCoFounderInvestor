# Health check configuration for backend service
# Railway will automatically ping /api/health to verify service health
# Service will be marked unhealthy if health check fails
# Railway manages restart attempts automatically based on the restart policy
# 
# Note: This is a single service deployment where the backend
# serves both the API and the built frontend static files.
