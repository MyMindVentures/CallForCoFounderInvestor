# DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS:
# 1. Git-based (current): Railway builds from Dockerfile on each push
# 2. Container Image: Use pre-built images from registry (ghcr.io, Docker Hub, etc.)
#    To switch: Railway Dashboard → Service → Settings → Source → "Container Image"
#    See docs/CONTAINER_DEPLOYMENT.md for details

# Health check configuration for backend service
# Railway will automatically ping /api/health to verify service health
# Service will be marked unhealthy if health check fails
# Railway manages restart attempts automatically based on the restart policy
# 
# Note: This is a single service deployment where the backend
# serves both the API and the built frontend static files.
