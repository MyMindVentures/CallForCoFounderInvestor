## The Story Behind This

> *"For months I've been trapped in a tooling loop — fighting through tutorials, broken builds, and endless learning curves. I'm an inventor at heart, not lacking in capability or vision, but lacking the bridge to turn ideas into shipped products."*

I'm **Kevin De Vlieger**, a 41-year-old Belgian now living in sunny **Alicante, Spain**. This project exists because I refuse to let another year pass without proof that my mind can create something real.

### The Negative Snowball

~~stress → fear → delays → debt~~

### ⬇️ Flips To ⬇️

### The Positive Snowball

**structure → shipping → proof → compounding**

## What I'm Looking For

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 💰 Financial Support Partner

**Temporary support now. Long-term upside later.**

- Lifetime 20% revenue share (net)
- Transparent revenue dashboard
- NDA + written agreement
- You're funding proof, not charity

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 👨‍💻 Solo Developer / Mentor

**Be the bridge from architect to shipped product.**

- Revenue split per project
- Daily short check-ins
- AI-native builder (Cursor, n8n, MCP)
- Goal: Make me independent

</td>

## The Quartet

<div align="center">

The magic happens when four forces align:

<br />

| 🧠 **Architect** | 🛠️ **Builder** | 💰 **Investor** | 🤖 **AI** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Me — Ideas, vision, features | You — Ship, mentor, teach | Breathing room | Leverage & speed |

<br />

**Structure turns it into results.**

</div>

<br />

<br />

## Two Apps Change Everything

I don't need ten apps. I need **two shipped apps** to show proof:

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" align="center">
<br />

**🧬 Lifemanagement Stack**

*My life back on rails*

<br />
</td>
<td width="50%" align="center">
<br />

**💡 IdeaFabric**

*Portable idea blueprint machine*

<br />
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br />

---

<br />

## My Give Away

I was always scared of idea stealing. But months of struggling alone taught me: **ideas without execution are just dreams.**

So this is my gift:
- This project and its source code
- A mindmap for an app that helps shape ideas (frontend + n8n backend)
- 90+ repos full of attempts and learnings
- Everything I've documented along the way

**If you believe, these are yours to build with me.**
